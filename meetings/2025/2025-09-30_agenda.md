  * Charters 
     * Review of PNG Chater [w3c/strategy#514](http://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/514): I don't see any critical issues, but it might be interesting to consider the [Threat Model related to file formats](https://github.com/w3c/security-request/issues/59#issuecomment -2622054799), given that there could still be memory corruption (e.g., [here](https://www.sasa-software.com/blog/png-file-vulnerabilities-content-inspection/)).
     * Review of AI Web IG Chater [w3c/strategy#511](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/511): We can have the AI Threat Models - [AI In Browser](https://github.com/w3c-cg/threat-modeling/blob/main/models/ai-in-browser.md), [Agentic AI Web Browsert](https://github.com/w3c-cg/threat-modeling/blob/main/models/agentic-ai-web-browsers.md) as a joint deliverables and a liaison
     * Review of [Media & Entertainment Interest Group Charter](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/520): Personally, I don't see any security issues, since they will ask for the documents to be reviewed anyway.
     * Review of [JSON-LD Working Group Charter](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/494): Here too, I don't see any problems, although it might make sense to specify a Threat Model linked to the issue of canonicalization when LDs are expressed and the integrity of external resource loading.

* Security Topics/Threat Models (30 mins)
  * Threat Stack presentation (from ETH Zurich)

* AOB
