## DC API

**Amir:**  
[sharing screen]  
- First thing is to try to understand the API and the flow, reading the spec  
- Our point is to understand how the cross-device flow is working  

**Tim:**  
- This is not part of the DC API; it is a different component, and it is layered  
- After the activation of the flow, similar to WebAuthn  
- It is managed by the platform itself, not by the API, and at the protocol level from [CTAP 2.2](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.2-ps-20250228/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.2-ps-20250228.html)  
- The only difference between this and passkeys is that it does not use section 7.6, as the format is different  
- Take care that the examples in the spec are still not updated  

**Zahara:**  
- We have the hybrid transport, but the difference is that we have JSON and not CBOR  

**Tim:**  
- Long-term goal is to send anything cross-device  
- Invocation can be via QR Code or linked device (e.g., Chrome and Android signed into the same Google account, similar to the approach for passkeys)  
- In the near future, we want to add proximity protocols such as NFC, like POS and more P2P experiences  
- Today, hybrid uses only network transport with a WebSocket; QR code is a mix between OS and browser; long term, it will be more OS (platform) driven  
- On crypto setup, there will be a public key and a secret code. When the device is there, it will be CBOR encoded, and the phone camera will invoke the Platform API and the credentials-provider-hosting device (CPHD wallet)

```
  0 Schema: [Client]] > [RS (e.g., Google rendezvous-server] <- authenticating web socket -> [CPHD wallet]
  1. Client: QR Code (containing a Public Key and Secret) -> photo scan -> [CPHD wallet];
  2. Client: starts advertising with BLE 
  3. Description key is derived from the info in the BLE, the credential provider hoster device 
  4. Client talks with RS, creating a key (long-term secret) to avoid the QR Code from being shown again.
```

**Amir:**  
- Thank you, really useful  
- Considering the case of a custom URL that can be abused  
- Who decides who can register as a Wallet? (malicious wallet scenario)

**Tim:**  
- This is platform-specific; e.g., entitlement (probably) on Apple  
- This document is useful from the early days but still relevant:  
  https://github.com/w3c-fedid/digital-credentials/blob/main/resources/DigitalCredentialsAPI-Layering-v20240301.pdf  
- App platform is as specific as the OS and related servers  
- Wallet native apps leverage APIs to talk to the platform  
- The platform + DC API will include a matcher  
- There will be a permission prompt, etc.  
- Cross-device flow uses a similar diagram, but wallet logic may be split across devices  
- The matcher is still not standardized; we will see what Apple does, but the concept will be similar
