### Screen Orientation API security review

Tommaso acknowledged Nishant's security review of the Screen Orientation API and presented his own additional findings.
- **Details**
    - **Tommaso**: Nishant's review followed threat analysis concepts looking at spoofing, tampering, and information disclosure
    - **Nishant**: Found no blocking issues but raised two questions: whether to recommend rate limiting for lock/unlock calls and whether to recommend a user-visible orientation locker indicator
    - **Tommaso**: Identified two additional normative gaps: permission policy for orientation data in iframes and strengthening anti-fingerprinting mitigation
    - **Tommaso**: Proposed disabling cross-origin orientation data sharing by default and making it opt-in
    - **Tommaso**: Suggested stronger anti-fingerprinting requirements should be "must" rather than "should" in the specification
- **Conclusion**
    - Issues have been opened on GitHub for feedback from the community
    - The group will follow up with the working group to improve the security of the standard
### Threat modeling approach

The group discussed approaches to threat modeling and security reviews.
- **Details**
    - **Simone**: Suggested documenting common threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks on Web APIs for reuse
    - **Simone**: Discussed the difference between threat models and security reviews
    - **Simone**: Working groups have complained that some threat models are too long (20 pages)
    - **Nishant**: Asked if it's possible to have synchronous meetings with working groups to discuss security concerns
    - **Tommaso**: Agreed that interaction with standard builders is valuable but can be challenging due to scheduling
    - **Simone**: Confirmed reviewers can request meetings with working groups through GitHub
- **Conclusion**
    - The group will work on documenting common threats for reuse
    - Interaction with working groups is encouraged to improve understanding
