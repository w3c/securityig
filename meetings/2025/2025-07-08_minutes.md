# Notes

**Tom Jones:**  
- Opened a discussion on the effective impact of the threat model for AI.

**Simone:**  
- The Chinese counterpart (W3C) is interested in the topic and has expressed direct interest in the threat model.  
- Agenda for the next topic: there is an overlap with the IETF meeting.  
- We have a room dedicated to the group at TPAC and hope to see each other face to face.  
- Now let's start the security review.

**Tom:**  
- The list of threats for the Digital Credential API has been presented, but the impact of the list is unclear.

**Amir:**  
- Overexposure of personal data and user consent is a relevant topic that was discussed in Geneva during the conference.

**Tom:**  
- The comment on this topic should be in the document (has it been shared?).

**Simone:**  
- We can integrate the threat model into the API; once we have the pull request, we can include these points and open the discussion with the team about mitigations.  
- Additionally, should we add the registration problem?

**Joe:**  
- The registry has been discussed as a point of control for quality, but this could also be an issue.

**Tom:**  
- This is a topic that has already been explored multiple times on the internet: how would the browser behave without a registry?

**Simone:**  
- Writing your own protocol into the registry requires the protocol to be free and accessible.

**Tom:**  
- Is this about threats?

**Joe:**  
- A registry is a way to close the internet.  
- Even without a registry, there is no guarantee of assurance about how implementations behave.  
- When you limit the channel of innovation, you limit protocol creation.  
- Registries do not scale and can limit the internet.

**Simone:**  
- Many implementation requirements will be included in the API regarding how to accept a protocol.  
- Some security requirements can be included in the protocol with or without a registry.  
- This may help avoid user tracking (e.g., like with EME).

**Tom:**  
- For DC API, you might not even be connected to the internet—how would you know how to sign it?

**Joe:**  
- The software should be able to handle the defined cases, and this is coming from the JSON—the tool is going to manage this complex issue.

**Tom:**  
- BLE can be the channel of the DC API and does not require internet connectivity.

**Joe:**  
- This technology has been designed to work online; the issue might be how to transfer that information to your device.

**Tom:**  
- If a website needs to be involved, the technology is not applicable.  
- If this is the case, this is not a good solution—it should work without a website.

**Joe:**  
- DC API is not solving all scenarios; it is focusing on a subset of scenarios.  
- The API targets how Digital Credentials are handled on the web.

**Simone:**  
- How DCs are handled in wallets is another path where you can use your wallet in emergency situations to present your credential.  
- The cross-device flow is also a concern and has been discussed with Tim Cappalli to understand how non-web use cases can be handled.  
- We can move on to the next topic; we will keep the group updated about the registry decision.  
- Now Amir will share what happened in Geneva.

**Amir:**  
- Threat-modelling presentation for the DC API: there was a lot of discussion and many complaints about cross-device flows and the use of the CTAP protocol with the rendezvous server involved.  
- Maybe with the right encryption, some concerns can be handled, but this needs to be expanded.  
- The threat-model game was successful, and we plan to have an online session.

**Simone:**  
- We plan to have a virtual session on **19 August** to play the game online with additional cards.

**Patrick:**  
- Three PhD students presented a holistic approach, and we plan to present it also to the SING group.  
- Identities are confined to silos managed by big corporations, but users now need to manage their own identity.  
- This requires a threat stack from hardware to cryptography to UX.  
- An application can be attacked across all layers; even a proof may not be a security solution.  
- One attack example is phishing—does this mean the whole wallet is compromised?  
- We need to build understanding for users and clarify this aspect.  
- Multiple secure protocols combined can create new insecure integration scenarios.  
- Feedback on the presentation was very positive.  
- One suggestion was to include the user in the design, especially regarding physical threats (e.g., being forced to open a digital wallet).  
- The order of stack elements is important and needs further discussion.  
- We plan to assemble all these threats and components; this can be valuable for the entire community, not only Digital Credentials.

**Simone:**  
- I like the idea of the stack; this may be a good opportunity to involve people from other groups.  
- Open the call to meet on **July 22** or **August 5**.  
- The group will meet on **August 5**, where we plan to present the stack and involve other groups.
