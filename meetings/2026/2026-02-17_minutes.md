## Notes

### Introuction

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** 
Today we have a very full agenda. Just as a reminder, the next meeting will be on March 3rd. We’ll open the agenda for the next topic, and we already have a presentation scheduled from Harsh at Amazon.

### Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Let’s now move to today’s main security topic: the discussion around the draft standard related to the Cyber Resilience Act. Simone already shared the presentation with me. I’ll try to put it in slideshow mode. Can everyone still see the screen?

* **Simone Onofri:** Yes.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Okay, good. Simone, I’ll help you navigate the slides. Let’s start with an introduction.

* **Simone Onofri:** Thank you. Today we’re going to talk about the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), which is a new European Union regulation. Its objective is to make the market more secure. In particular, it introduces the presumption of conformity for products placed on the European market, including web browsers.  
There is currently a draft standard defining cybersecurity requirements for browsers to facilitate presumption of conformity with the CRA. The Security Interest Group agreed to serve as a discussion forum for the W3C community and to provide feedback. Giovanni and I reviewed the document over the past weeks and collected initial high-level feedback from members.  
Today we want to provide an overview of the specification and share our initial comments. Then we can also discuss how to communicate effectively with ETSI.  
The draft specification is around 400 pages long, and the deadlines are tight. Feedback is requested by the end of February, or at worst by the end of March, because in October the draft needs to be submitted to the European Commission for approval. The regulation will then become fully applicable one year later.  
Let me briefly describe the structure of the specification.  
The first section defines the scope — that is, which types of browsers and deployments are in scope. I’m using the terminology from the draft, which may differ slightly from W3C terminology.  
The second part contains references — both normative and informative.  
Later sections define terminology and describe the product context, including browser components and operational environments.  
Part 6 is the largest section and focuses on the technical security assessment — essentially how conformity is assessed.  
There are also several annexes. We focused particularly on Annex A, which is important because it maps the draft standard to the CRA requirements. It establishes the connection between the technical draft and the legal text.  
Regarding scope, one of our comments is that the specification does not clearly define which parts of the browser and web ecosystem are in scope and which are out of scope. This is important because the document sets obligations — not only technical requirements but also governance-related obligations, such as vulnerability handling.  
We need clearer distinctions between different browser implementations, standard browsers, embedded browsers, and applications embedding browser capabilities.  
For example, the draft includes super applications — such as WeChat in China — which integrate browser functionality and mini-app ecosystems. In those cases, the super application is in scope, but the mini-apps themselves (that is, the websites loaded within the super app) are generally not.  
Similarly, Progressive Web Applications (PWAs), which are developed by web developers, are mostly out of scope, except in specific contexts. For example, if a device such as a NAS includes a web-based management interface, that web application may fall within scope because it is part of the product itself.  
So one of our key feedback points is that the specification should clearly distinguish what is in scope and what is out of scope.  
Another issue concerns references. The draft references various specifications, including W3C specifications, editor’s drafts, GitHub pages, and community group documents. We think that stable W3C Recommendations should be preferred as references. Referencing editor’s drafts or unstable community documents creates governance challenges, especially when the standard is meant to support regulatory compliance.  
We also observed that definitions sometimes reference online documents in ways that may not be stable over time.  
Now I’ll pass it to Giovanni for the next interesting part of the document.

* **Giovanni Corti:** Thank you. Clause 4 is where the document really begins. It defines the environments, functionalities, and components that are in scope or out of scope for the assessment. It also provides several use cases — I believe nine or ten — illustrating different deployment contexts.   
Part of the assessment depends on the context in which the browser is deployed, which is why these use cases are relevant.  
Clause 4 also includes a very high-level architectural description of a web browser, including process mappings. This resembles a threat model, but it is prescriptive in nature.  
Our suggestion is that this section should instead provide one or more high-level descriptive threat models — for example, including data flow diagrams (DFDs) — that could serve as a basis for risk assessment.  
The CRA obligations are risk-based, so a clear threat model would support a more coherent mapping to legal requirements.  
Clause 5 adopts a capability-centric structure. ETSI identifies browser capabilities, associates conditions with them, and structures requirements accordingly. Conceptually, this resembles a security profile linked to risk levels, but this relationship should be made more explicit.  
Many of the concepts referenced are already defined in W3C documents — including TAG architectural guidance — and in IETF documents for the network layer.  
Clause 6 maps assessments to each identified capability and condition. Our suggestion is that the mapping between Clause 6, Clause 5, and Annex A (the CRA requirements) should be clearer.  
We also recommend relying explicitly on existing test suites, such as Web Platform Tests, rather than reinventing assessment mechanisms.  
Finally, Annex A maps CRA requirements to technical implementations. Currently, this mapping is informative. However, if cited in the Official Journal of the European Union, compliance with the normative clauses would provide presumption of conformity. Therefore, this mapping has significant regulatory implications.  
A well-defined threat model would enable a more precise mapping of applicable threats, assets, attack surfaces, and trust relationships to CRA Articles 13(1) and 13(2), as well as Annex I requirements.  
That concludes our initial feedback.  

* **Simone Onofri:** Thank you, Giovanni. This was a challenging top-down review. These are high-level comments, and we can also go deeper — for example, into specific APIs that may or may not be in scope.  
At a high level, we believe the document should be more risk-based, grounded in an explicit threat model. Implementers could then adapt the model to their specific use cases and derive conformity requirements accordingly.  
For assessment, the principle should be not to reinvent the wheel. We already have many security requirements in W3C specifications. The draft should rely on them where possible.  
There are also some UI requirements — for example, signaling when a microphone is in use — which are reasonable to define, but overall the structure should be clearer.  
We welcome feedback. If anyone would like to review specific parts, we’re happy to coordinate.  

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Thank you, Simone and Giovanni. This is a very large document, and I think everyone will need time to digest it.  
I have a logistical question: how should we collect and consolidate feedback from the group? What is the best approach to collaborate and submit coordinated feedback?

* **Simone Onofri:** We can use the mailing list and consolidate comments there. People can also send comments privately, and we can aggregate them before submitting formal feedback.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** That makes sense.  
If there are no further comments, we can continue the discussion offline to give people time to review the draft and prepare input.

* **Tom Jones:** My general comment is that the scope seems too narrow. It doesn’t allow for threat models that reflect real-world situations. In my experience, security issues often arise when moving in and out of the browser context. That transition space is often insecure, and it seems intentionally left out of scope. From my perspective, that makes the standard less helpful. For example Digital Credentials API is in scope?

* **Joe Andrieu:** I’ve only just been exposed to this draft. I’m surprised there aren’t more diagrams. It feels like the browser is treated in isolation. I don’t see modeling of the browser in context — within a device or network — and that significantly affects the threat model.

* **Simone Onofri:** Yes, I agree. More diagrams are needed. Your point about browser-in-context aligns with our feedback. We will update our analysis accordingly.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Thank you for the feedback. Let’s move to the next agenda item: WebMCP.

### WebMCP

* **Tom Jones:** I tried to create a threat model for WebMCP, and I immediately ran into the same issue: what is the context? The system is complex, and the security implications are significant.  
One concern is privacy. The document states that the user is in control, but I don’t see how that control is implemented. For example, if the browser connects to a site without explicit user approval and shares data, privacy is compromised without transparency.

* **Johan:** If the document claims that privacy is in the user’s control without explaining how, that’s something we should file as an issue. We shouldn’t make such statements without explanation.

* **Joe Andrieu:** In the WebMCP draft, I don’t see strong privacy claims. The privacy and security considerations section appears incomplete. That itself may be the issue.

* **Tom Jones:** I may have conflated MCP more broadly with WebMCP. My concern is that the architecture could easily undermine privacy.

* **Johan:** WebMCP should be considered separately from MCP, even if inspired by it. We should review it as its own proposal.

* **Tom Jones:** Okay, that’s helpful clarification. My concern remains that the scope and privacy implications need to be clearly defined. Without that, it’s very difficult to build a meaningful threat model.

* **Johan:** That makes sense. If there are gaps — especially around privacy or user control — we should document them explicitly and file issues. It’s better to identify those concerns early.

* **Joe Andrieu:** I agree. If the privacy and security considerations sections are incomplete, that’s something we should call out. Even if no claims are being made, the absence of guidance is itself a risk.

* **Tom Jones:** Yes, I think that’s part of my frustration. The absence of clear constraints makes it hard to evaluate.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** So, would it make sense to start by defining a clearer context and scope for WebMCP before attempting a full threat model?

* **Tom Jones:** Yes, I think that would help. Without understanding what is in scope and what is not, it’s difficult to reason about threats.

* **Johan:** I agree. If we can clarify the intended deployment model — for example, whether it’s browser-only, browser-plus-server, or something else — then we can reason more concretely.

* **Joe Andrieu:** And perhaps we should explicitly separate what is assumed to be under user control and what is not. That would already reduce ambiguity.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** That sounds like a good next step. Maybe Tom, you can open issues summarizing your concerns, and we can iterate from there?

* **Tom Jones:** Yes, I can do that. I’ll try to structure the issues around scope, privacy control, and context assumptions.

* **Johan:** That would be very helpful. If you can reference specific sections where you see gaps, we can respond more concretely.

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Great. If there are no further comments on WebMCP, we can wrap up this discussion for today.  
(Pause.)

* **Tommaso Innocenti:** Okay, thank you everyone for the discussion. As usual, please continue the conversation on the mailing list. We’ll revisit these topics in the next meeting once we’ve had time to review and file issues.  
Thank you all for joining.
