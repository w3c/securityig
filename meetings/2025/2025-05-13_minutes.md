## Group Deliverables/Threat Models/Security Topics

- Tom: 
    - complains for Google, on putting AI in the browser
  - if you have an AI in the browswer that learns from input

- Joe:
     - We need a better definition of AI and in which part in the browser

- Tom:
    - If you can use Javascript to poison the DOM/browser is a problem

- Joe: 
     - I was thinking about the memory manipulation 
     - One thing is to have an AI extention to change the HTML/DOM
     - Another thing is if an IA can manipulate what I see in the future?
     
- Kevin:
     - for the general threat, comparable to XSS

- Tom:
     - it is not clear what is the AI in the browser, as they described
      - The main point is that there are no distinction between user and javascript

- Joe:
    - This is similar to the discussion of phone home from IIW
    - question is we are small players, having some inflfuence and it is good to talk about these topics
    - so other people can hear, explaining to a non-technical people
    - our job is to talk about this topics, and we can understand how to address the tradeoffs

- Tom:
     - I had a similar problem with Payments 

- Joe:
     - on phone home, started at IIW, he analyzed the mDL from an hacker's perspective
     - you can change retreival of information to embed the phone home feature
     - this is a slippery issue about possibilty to phone home
     - the challenge we have is your security policy it can be changed by the next regime

- Simone:
     - we sholud check on the digital credentials API registry for the phone home
     - for the AI threat model, feel free to write an Issue/PR

- Joe:
     - On this https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/272 it seems the last comment makes the point
     
- Tom:
     -  Senario a website is compromised, and it can call javascript from the user's browser.
