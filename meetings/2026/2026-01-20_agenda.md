     * [charters](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Horizontal+review+requested%22++-label%3A%22Security+review+completed%22+-label%3ACouncil)
  * **[Web Editing Working Group Charter review](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/522)**: I don't see any particular blockers, but they certainly have security implications, and their considerations should be kept in mind.
