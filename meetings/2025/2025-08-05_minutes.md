## Notes

### Next meetings

**Simone**
- The next meeting is scheduled for August 19  
- A reminder that we have a space at TPAC (Friday)  
- There is a lot of interest in hearing our work on Security, specifically on Agentic security.

### Privacy in EUDI Wallet

**Denis:**
- We're reflecting on ZKP protocol zk-longfellow [sharing the screen]
- Question is to mitigate something similar to EME (huge case in history)
- Google longfellow-zk is great, based on fast cryptographic circuits
- There is also a pilot with Sparkasse in DE
- But it is implemented in the Google Play API
- There were some complaints in the community about the usage of wallets inside the Google Store
- In theory, the passage from mDoc to ZKP-circuit will pass inside the OS APIs, which can have telemetry
- We need a sandbox to mitigate this
- There was an old article, *"Reconciling Mozilla's Mission and W3C EME,"* that was an interesting lesson learned
- As Mozilla doesn't want to run closed-source software, they sandboxed it (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox), implementing a trust boundary
- This is a solution that I think we can propose to the Digital Credentials scenario
- I've run some tests in my VM

**Tommaso:**
- Is this the only sandbox?

**Denis:**
- As far as I know, it is the best-documented one I have found. But Google has a similar feature for executing WASM.
- We can think about a standardized approach to them.

**Samuel:**
- The idea is that we need a sandbox for Digital Identities?
- I have some experience in developing ZKP systems.
- It is also better than the sandbox, also for its interesting functionalities—we need verifiable privacy.
- What comes out of the sandbox is a huge object.
- We need something more "beefy."

**Denis:**
- I agree. Talking about definitions, maybe “Air Gapped” is better?
- The requirement is not to expose mDoc cleartext data to other parties.

**Samuel:**
- Each sandbox runs in the trust area of the OS, so the OS can inspect, even if there is a policy on not doing it.
- Maybe an enclave, even if they are a nightmare to deploy; or the user can administer it, but it is not usable for all.
- It is a good problem; a policy route is good.

**Kevin:**
- It is important to find good terminology; we should find the requirements for the sandbox.

**Samuel:**
- Agree, we also have something in the IETF.

**Simone:**
- Good to have a breakout session at TPAC.

## Digital Integration API Analysis

**Amir:**  
- Query Language: this is something more within the scope of the Protocol  
- If we have the registry, we have the security analysis, and this can be a potential mitigation  
- There is another discussion about whether having just a registry plus security analysis is enough  

**Simone:**  
- As an example, we can have OpenID4VC. I have a PR asking them to add Injection as a Security Consideration section.

**Amir:**  
- In that specific case, they also performed formal verification; we need to check whether they included the query language or not.

**Tom:**  
- Are we talking about a registry of protocols, not about query languages?

**Amir:**  
- Yes, there are: DC API → Protocol → Query Languages, but we can put some requirements on it.  
- Maybe we can make this link public so that we can discuss in the open.  
- Data Minimization: we already have it in our analysis.

**Zahara:**  
- About the Wallet and Browser trust boundaries: the point is that we assume some trust assumptions. Do we need to consider the browser to be non-compromised?

**Joe:**  
- It is important to understand which components and threats are inherent, and whether we want to do something about them.

**Simone:**  
- It is similar to the approach used for encrypting and signing the request in an end-to-end fashion, making it difficult to intercept in a standardized way.

**Amir:**  
- Phoning home: we're thinking of adding some requirements, but it is not in the API itself.  
- Also, regarding Gov: in the EU there is a list of trusted websites that can ask for the request.

**Simone:**  
- It depends on a defense-in-depth approach. At least one part needs to be checked.  
- We have the wallet as it is regulated; we should think about whether the browser should also enforce this check.  
- Phoning home is an issue not directly inside the DC API.
