## Security Interest Group Call

### Introductions

*Simone Onofri*: Hello. Good morning, good evening, good night.

*Simone Onofri*: As usual, I have enabled our AI Overlord to assist with the minutes, to avoid making humans suffer. I will elaborate manually later and publish them. We have many participants today. We have a very nice agenda.

*Simone Onofri*: If you are here, it is because you are part of the Security Interest Group, and we are trying to make the Web safer. Please discuss topics and not people; we all share the same objective.

*Simone Onofri*: For queue management, please use Zoom’s “raise hand” feature. If you want to paste links, please use the Zoom chat.

*Simone Onofri*: Today we also have participants from RDF, the core of the Semantic Web. They asked to use some documents, and the idea is for them to explain what they are building. This fits well with applying the threat modeling process, which I published today.

*Simone Onofri*: Working groups know best what they are building, and this helps us understand specifications faster and identify threats and attacks more effectively. Please introduce yourselves.

*Pierre-Antoine Champin*: I am Pierre-Antoine Champin. I work at W3C as a Data Strategist, working closely with most groups related to data on the Web, including the RDF and SPARQL Working Groups. I am also a co-editor of several specifications.

*Ora Lassila*: I am Ora Lassila, co-chair of the RDF and SPARQL Working Group. I was one of the first co-editors of the original RDF specification in the late 1990s. I have worked on the Semantic Web ever since, and I work for AWS.

*Adrian Gschwend*: I have worked for many years in this space, and RDF-related work is my daily activity.

*Simone Onofri*: I am Simone from W3C, helping with the security aspects, especially around data security. It is great that we have this joint discussion.

*Kevin Dean*: I am Kevin Dean from Legendary Requirements. I participate in W3C in this group, as well as in work on Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.

*nishantjain*: Hi, I am Nishant Jain. I am an invited expert in the Security Interest Group, and I work for Atlassian.

*Tommaso Innocenti*: I am Tommaso Innocenti. I work for AWS and I am a co-chair of the Security Interest Group.

*Patrick Schaller*: My name is Patrick Schaller. I work at a Swiss university as a researcher in information security. I am the Advisory Committee representative of ETH Zurich at W3C and co-chair of the Security Interest Group.

### Threat Modeling RDF

*Simone Onofri*: The goal is to understand what you are building. In threat modeling, one of the first things we do is create a diagram of the technology, such as a data format, a system, or an API. The key question is: what are you building?

*Joe Andrieu*: One of the key things I look for is a visual diagram of the components involved in the system. Without a diagram, we often talk past each other. The diagram helps define scope and boundaries.

*Ora Lassila*: RDF started as a metadata model, with use cases like digital libraries. It then evolved into a general knowledge representation formalism. RDF is an abstract data model, often described as a directed labeled graph, and it has multiple concrete syntaxes for serialization and transmission.

*Ora Lassila*: RDF defines formal semantics, which allow inference: things that are not explicitly stated in a graph may still be considered true. RDF also has a query language, SPARQL, which matches patterns in graphs and supports traversal.

*Ora Lassila*: RDF is largely independent of how it is used. It has little to do with browsers, although browsers could technically process RDF. Most of RDF belongs in the data representation layer of a network stack.

*Adrian Gschwend*: RDF is typically implemented behind the scenes. Browser vendors do not usually implement RDF directly. Implementations are often graph databases that expose SPARQL over HTTP. In browsers, RDF is usually handled through JavaScript libraries.

*Simone Onofri*: One criticism raised in the context of Verifiable Credentials was canonicalization of RDF and graph isomorphism. Graph isomorphism is complex and can introduce risks.

*Pierre-Antoine Champin*: RDF does not define processes or actors explicitly, but we do talk about clients and servers, producers and consumers. We implicitly define processes such as parsing, serializing, graph comparison, entailment, and isomorphism. Because graph isomorphism is complex, it can be used for denial-of-service attacks, and we added text about this in the security considerations.

*Joe Andrieu*: Injection and other threats usually arise when the abstract model is embodied in software. Serialization, parsing, querying, and augmentation of graphs are all places where risks can occur. It can be helpful to explicitly call out what is in scope and what is out of scope for the abstract data model.

*Pierre-Antoine Champin*: Some security considerations already exist, such as the use of IRIs and the risk of visually deceptive Unicode characters. RDF does not require dereferencing IRIs, but people may do so, and that can create risks.

*Joe Andrieu*: That is exactly the right approach: identify dependencies, point to where risks may arise, and reference the relevant specifications, even if the mitigation is outside the scope of RDF itself.

*Tom Jones*: From experience, if graphs are used without signing, it becomes impossible to know whether the graph being used is the graph that was originally created. This inevitably leads to misuse and security problems.

*Adrian Gschwend*: Similar issues exist in relational databases. RDF is closer to a data representation layer, and many of these problems are not unique to RDF.

*Ora Lassila*: We have deliberately avoided philosophical notions of truth in RDF. Authenticity and integrity are difficult to define in this context and may be outside the scope of what RDF specifies.

*Adrian Gschwend*: Specifications provide test suites. These allow implementers to validate that their implementations behave as expected. What happens beyond that, in application logic, is another layer.

### Charters Review

*Simone Onofri*: Web Editing Working Group Charter review https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/522:  I don't see any particular blockers, but they certainly have security implications, and their considerations should be kept in mind.

### CSS Review

*nishantjain*: I shared a threat model based on the recently published guide https://github.com/realArcherL/W3C-Reviews/blob/main/reviews/css-color-adjust-1.md. The threats I identified were already considered in the specification. One notable issue is that the spec increases the fingerprinting surface, and this should be acknowledged with non-normative guidance.

*Joe Andrieu*: A diagram would help clarify how components connect and expose attack surfaces. Numbering threats in the table would also make collaboration easier.

*Simone Onofri*: We can share the document for another review round and then open issues in the repository. 

### Call for Consensus for Adoption and First Note Draft of Threat Model for Digital Credentials API

*Simone Onofri*: If there are no objections, I will issue a call for consensus on the documents. 
[no objections]

### AOB

*Simone Onofri*: There will also be breakout days in March, https://github.com/w3c/breakouts-day-2026/issues which would be a good opportunity to present our work.
