## Threat Stack

**Patrick**: Prepared initially for the Geneva conference, by 
... the idea was to map all the threats to identity systems

**Sheila**: similar to the one also at DICE
[showing the slides]
[slide 1]
[slide 2]
[slide 3]
The problem is that we want to have an identity system that can be trusted

[slide 4]
At the moment, all identities are using paper documents, also for medical records, and are having highly sensitive data
We have security, privacy risks, and societal impact, in particular for non-digitally savvy users
We have many attack vectors, e.g., DoS, Data Breaches, Relay Attacks, and account takeovers

[slide 5]
It is a complex design space that covers different use cases, e.g., enterprises and governments, stakeholders (e.g., issuers, users, verifiers), and different security tools (e.g., formal, game-based, threat models).

[slide 6]
There are different state-of-the-art threat modeling (e.g., formal, STIRDE), with different threats identified, but they also have potential issues with terminology and threat definitions.

[slide 7]
Also, assumptions can differ; e.g., cryptography implementations may note some assumptions but not the ones that are implicit.

[slide 8]
also different trade-offs, e.g., security vs usability trade-off

**Carolin**:

[slide 9]
[showing the stack to bridge these gaps]
with lower layers influencing the one on top

[slide 10]
math foundations: determine the hardness of the problems, abstract algebra (e.g., P = NP?), post-quantum

[slide 11]
crypto primitives: encryption and random numbers

[slide 12]
Hardware platform: memory, CPU, secure elements, OS, etc, e.g., malware compromise.

[slide 13]
Communication Protocols, Specifications: e.g., EMV credit card protocol, 5G issues

[slide 14]
Standards, Role assignment: parameters choice for cryptographic primitives, and associate roles with entities, e.g., BBS/BBS+ Signatures issues

[slide 15]
Implementations: different software, e.g., wallet, verifiers, issuers' apps/clients, third-party libraries, documentation, e.g., vaccination platform in Switzerland; leak of biometric police data in India. We can use program verification, such as Viper

[slide 16]
Usability, interoperability: UX design, ecosystem, interoperability
Example: dusting attacks on crypto, or buggy COVID certificates app

[slide 17]
It is possible to calculate Risk = Impact * Likelihood, considering risk acceptance, risk transfer (e.g., insurance), risk avoidance (e.g., reducing or removing some components), and risk mitigation.

[slide 18]
Recuing likelihood: assumptions, design, implementation with crypto proofs, formal protocol verification, program verification

[slide 19]

[slide 20]
On protocols, it is important to look at them not only in isolation but also when they interact

[slide 21]
**Sheila**: How can we use this as a living model? This can be adapted, and we can consolidate layers, or split up, or also remove layers, also reordering layers, and adding layers, e.g., adding users and regulators, always with the concept of a higher layer depending on lower layers

[slide 22]
It is a modular development by different entities, also for component reuse

[slide 23]
this to enable a holistic approach required (security properties, adv modes, security proofs, threat models, risk assessment...

**Kevin**: Impressed by this terrific work, I would like to use it.

**Sheila**: (HR in Threat Stack) This can be in the user layer, e.g., when people cannot be left behind if they are not tech-savvy savy 

**Tom**: There are also different things, maybe they are not good to put in the same place
**Sheila**: The idea is also to use the TS to share the language
**Tommaso**: This can be a stack, like a network stack, so that everyone talks at a different layer. For example, how do you "pass" this information (e.g., threat models and assumptions)? In general, I see a lot of potential in this idea.
**Patrick**: Thank you. A first low-hanging fruit is to show the interaction between the different layers of the job already done
**Tommaso**: Having a way to make the different layers communicate is a great value
