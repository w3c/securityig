# Threat Models
* We have the [Threat Modeling Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/tmcg/) to discuss, incubate, and jointly develop (also during calls) various threat models related to security, privacy, and harms. Threat Models can then be adopted by the Security Interest Group or other relevant groups.
* If you want to create or participate in a Threat Model, you can join the Community Group and make Pull Requests from the [repository](https://github.com/w3c-cg/threat-modeling).
