# Security Intrest Group Meetings

This repository contains agendas, minutes, and other materials from meetings of the [Security Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/security/).

Logistics, agendas, and minutes for all meetings are in our GitHub meetings repository. We meet in plenary once a month; we occasionally have ad-hoc calls on specific topics and expect to meet in person at the annual W3C TPAC.

The scheduling and logistics of ad hoc calls may vary depending on the topic and expected attendees. Agendas and minutes for such meetings are posted in the same place as our regularly-scheduled plenary calls.

Calendar details are located [here](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/security/calendar/). You must sign in to see the logistics.
