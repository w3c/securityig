## Threat Modeling with LEGO SERIOUS PLAY

**Giovanni:** Assistant Researcher at FKB, working on ID Security and on harms, also with Amir.  
We conducted a session that began with an exploration of some harms, which proved very effective in validating both the harms and the LEGO method for this purpose.  
The results were very good.

## Human Rights in Standards

**Simone:**  I'm working on a presentation, collecting experience and ideas from the W3C https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bXwUDVfQbdthMrctilwnoQjjmBXuAY-o0LYrcBdZ57M/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p

**Kevin:**  
Certainly, other things to consider are geographical representation, the fact that the focus is on delivering results, and that, in many respects, governments are in charge by providing requirements and funding.

## TV and AI

**Simone:** We don't have Tom, but in general, this can also be a topic for Web & AI IG.
